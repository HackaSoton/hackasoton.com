American Express is visiting Southampton! Come by for a chill evening with smart people, a fun quiz, and Domino's pizza.

**Date**: 20 Nov 2018

**Time**: 6pm - 8pm (and pub afterwards)

**Location**: Maths Student Centre (Building 56)

> Having your own personal website can be a great way to stand out from the crowd. The aim of the workshop is to give attendees the tools to build and deploy their very own website. Weâ€™ll cover some examples, what to include, popular technologies and deployment methods. Whether you already have your own website and are simply looking to get it online or you havenâ€™t even begun, weâ€™ll have something useful for you! The session will consist of a short introduction, followed by hands-on help from American Express demonstrators.
