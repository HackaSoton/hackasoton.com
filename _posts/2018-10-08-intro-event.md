- **Where:** B46/2003
- **When:** 9 Oct — 6pm

Join us for our first event of the year! Here are some reasons that should make you come to our event:

## Reason #1: Meet the committee

You'll get to see our faces (again). Ok, I don't know why this is number 1. Keep reading.

## Reason #2: Learn more about Hack The South

We're organising 1 big hackathon this year, [Hack The South](https://hackthesouth.co.uk).

To convince you it's worth coming, we'll show you photos of the prizes, food, games, fun, and winning projects from last year (Hack The South — May 2018). Then we will proceed with more propaganda disguised as stories from past participants (well, 2 of our committee members).

## Reason #3: Trip to a hackathon in the UK

This year we're organising 2 trips to hackathons — one in the UK (first semester) and one in mainland Europe (second semester). At the event we're going to announce our hackathon pick for the first semester.

## Reason #4: Have a slice of pizza

Good if you're hungry. The number of slices you get depends on how many people click Going on our [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/303999220381603/) (seriously). Click that link right now, press Going, and invite your friends.

## Reason #5: Three £10 quiz winners

We'll pick 3 winners and award them a £10 Amazon gift card each. Winners must be in the room to claim the prize. There's still time to fill in the quiz: [hackasoton.com/bc](http://hackasoton.com/bc).

## Reason #6: Cool jobs & sponsors

Learn about our sponsors and their spring week, internships, and graduate jobs: [Deutsche Bank](https://hackthesouth.co.uk/db.html) and [American Express](https://hackthesouth.co.uk/amex.html).
