To get everyone ready and excited for Hack The South 2019, we are organising a pre-hackathon event! Join us for a relaxed evening where you can learn tips & tricks about hackathons and meet fellow participants.

The event has 2 parts. The first part will be an informational presentation with general tips about hackathons. The second part will be a fun game (surprise!), followed by networking and pizza.
