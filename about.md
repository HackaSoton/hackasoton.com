# What is HackaSoton?

<b style="font-family: Orbitron;">HackaSoton</b> is a tech-entrepreneurial society based at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton. The society has one longstanding goal: to bridge the gap between those with technical skills and those without, encouraging the sharing of knowledge and skills. We do this through our hackathons, hack spaces, talks, trips, and tutorials.

# Who can join?

Any student currently enrolled at the University of Southampton.

# What are your plans for the 18/19 academic year?

We'll be running 1 big hackathon with the most talented developers, flying drones, RC cars, an HTC Vive, free food & drinks, and of course — plenty of fun. We have help from awesome sponsors and volunteers. Check it out at [hackthesouth.co.uk](https://hackthesouth.co.uk)!

We're also going to make a few trips during the year to hackathons or tech conferences in the UK or mainland Europe. If you're a student at the University of Southampton, feel free to join our society and come with us!
